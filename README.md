## Impact of Precipitation on NYC MTA Ridership
Analyzing the impact of weather on ridership

### Jupyter Notebooks:
1. Turnstile Data: Create table with average `Entries` and `Exits` per station over time
2. Weather Data: Create table with appropriate precipitation data
3. Station Location: Create table with subway station locations
4. Merging Tables: Merging data wanted into one table
5. Data Analysis: Analyzing data.

### Data:
1. [Turnstile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html): Cumulative entry and exit values for every station in the MTA ecosystem.
2. Weather: Hourly precipitation totals
3. Station Location: CSV with subway locations.

### Further Work
* Use Latitude/Longitude for more accurate precipitation impact assessment
* Create a prediction model to anticipate impact of precipitation on ridership
* Impact of Temperature on Ridership
